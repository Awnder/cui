    "# The \"Perfect\" Cipher - One Time Pads\n",
    "\n",
    "After WWI died down, us Americans finally made a significant contribution to the field of cryptography. (Cheeky note: it must have been a Brit' like Singh who wrote that first sentence, because us Americans did some incredible code-making and code-breaking work in WWII). Anyway, the Americans found that one of the only real weaknesses of the Vigenére Cipher was that the key was used reptitively, allowing a cryptanalyst to look for patterns and then perform frequency analysis. But what if the key was really long. What if it was really, really long? The longer the key, the smaller sample that cryptanalysts would have for frequency analysis. What if we made the key the same length as the plaintext? Then there would be absolutely no patterns and the ciphertext would be perfectly secure.\n",
    "\n",
    "Early One Time Pad Ciphers used a long key that was created from dictionary words. As time went on, the cryptanalysts discovered new ways to crack the Onetime Pads and cryptographers found new ways to secure them."
